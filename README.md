# covid
random viz functions for Covid-19 data. Pretty hacky, but they work.

You can see the results at https://sgouros.com/covid

The R scripts are set up to run as shell scripts, and I run them each
day to keep the displays updated.  Use the 'getData' script in the
data directory to get the latest data, then run each of the scripts,
and the resulting images should appear in the images directory.

Uses data from:  https://covidtracking.com
And JHU data: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
And WHO data: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data

Looking for other data sources and taking requests.  (Open an issue in
the issues tracker.)  Thanks!
